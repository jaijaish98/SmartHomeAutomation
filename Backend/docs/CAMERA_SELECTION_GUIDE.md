## üéØ Features

### **Automatic Camera Discovery**

The system automatically detects:

1. **üé• Built-in Webcam** - Your laptop's integrated camera
2. **üé• External USB Cameras** - Any USB cameras connected to your computer
3. **üìπ RTSP IP Cameras** - Network cameras configured in `credentials.yaml`

### **Camera Information Display**

For each camera, you'll see:
- **Name** - Descriptive name (Built-in, External, Tapo, etc.)
- **Type** - Webcam or RTSP
- **Resolution** - Frame dimensions
- **FPS** - Frames per second
- **Device Index** - For webcams only

### **Smart Mirroring**

- **Webcams** - Horizontally flipped for natural mirror view (like looking in a mirror)
- **RTSP Cameras** - Original orientation (no flip, as IP cameras are usually mounted)

## üöÄ How to Use

### **1. Run the Application**

```bash
cd object_detection
./run.sh
```

Or:
```bash
python scripts/detect_objects.py
```

### **2. Select Your Camera**

When the menu appears, enter the number of the camera you want to use:

```
üìå Select a camera (1-3) or 'q' to quit: 2
```

Press **Enter**.

### **3. Start Detecting!**

The application will:
- ‚úÖ Initialize the selected camera
- ‚úÖ Start object detection
- ‚úÖ Display real-time results

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Modes

### **Interactive Mode (Default - Recommended)**

Shows the camera selection menu every time:

```yaml
# config/config.yaml
camera_source:
  mode: "interactive"
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Easy to switch between cameras
- ‚úÖ See all available cameras
- ‚úÖ No manual configuration needed

**Cons:**

camera_source:
  mode: "auto"
  type: "webcam"  # or "rtsp"
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ No user input required
- ‚úÖ Faster startup
- ‚úÖ Good for automation/scripts

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't easily switch cameras
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to edit config to change camera

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **No Cameras Found**

**Problem:**
```
‚ùå No cameras found!
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Camera Connections**
   - Ensure webcams are plugged in
   - Check USB connections
   - Verify RTSP camera is powered on

2. **Check Permissions (macOS)**
   - Go to: System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Camera
   - Enable camera access for Terminal/Python

3. **Check RTSP Configuration**
   - Verify `credentials.yaml` has correct RTSP URL
   - Test RTSP URL in VLC player
   - Ensure camera is on the network

---

### **Camera Not Detected**

**Problem:**
Camera is connected but not showing in the list.

**Solutions:**

1. **Webcam:**
   - Try unplugging and replugging
   - Check if another app is using the camera
   - Restart your computer

2. **RTSP Camera:**
   - Verify RTSP is enabled in camera settings
   - Check network connectivity: `ping <camera-ip>`
   - Test URL in VLC: Media ‚Üí Open Network Stream

---

### **Camera Initialization Failed**

**Problem:**
```
‚ùå Failed to initialize camera
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Close Other Apps**
   - Close Zoom, Skype, FaceTime, etc.
   - Only one app can use a webcam at a time

2. **Check Camera Settings**
   - Verify resolution and FPS are supported
   - Try default settings (width=0, height=0, fps=0)

3. **RTSP Issues**
   - Check credentials are correct
   - Verify network connection
   - Try increasing timeout in config.yaml

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### **Choosing the Right Camera**

**For Testing:**
- Use built-in webcam (fastest setup)

**For Better Quality:**
- Use external USB camera (better resolution/FPS)

**For Fixed Installation:**
- Use RTSP IP camera (professional, remote access)

---

### **Performance Optimization**

**Webcam:**
- Lower resolution = faster processing
- 640x480 is good for real-time detection
- 1920x1080 for better quality (slower)

**RTSP:**
- Use `stream2` for lower quality/faster speed
- Set `buffer_size: 1` to reduce lag
- Ensure good network connection

---

### **Multiple Cameras**

**Switching Cameras:**
1. Press 'q' to exit current session
2. Run the application again
3. Select a different camera

**Using Multiple Cameras Simultaneously:**
- Currently not supported
- Run multiple instances with different configs
- Set `mode: "auto"` and different `type` for each
