# Before and After - Simplified Launch

## ❌ BEFORE (Tedious - 4 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

cd object_detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Wait for installation...*

### Step 2: Download Model
```bash
python scripts/download_models.py
```
*Wait for 23 MB download...*

### Step 3: Test Setup
```bash
python scripts/test_setup.py
```
*Check if everything works...*

### Step 4: Run Detection
```bash
python scripts/detect_objects.py
```
*Finally running!*

**Total: 4 commands, multiple steps, easy to forget**
