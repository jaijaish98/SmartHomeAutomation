## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start (Your Tapo Camera)

**1. Camera is Already Configured!**

Your credentials are in `object_detection/config/credentials.yaml`:
```yaml
rtsp:
  url: "rtsp://jaijaish98-camera1:jaiSATHU@2407@192.168.0.233:554/stream1"
```

**2. Select RTSP as Camera Source**

Edit `object_detection/config/config.yaml`:
```yaml
camera_source:
  type: "rtsp"  # Already set!
```

**3. Run Object Detection**

```bash
cd object_detection
./run.sh
```

Or:
```bash
python scripts/detect_objects.py
```

**That's it!** Object detection will now use your Tapo camera feed.

## 🔄 Switching Between Cameras

### Use Webcam

Edit `config/config.yaml`:
```yaml
camera_source:
  type: "webcam"
```

### Use RTSP Camera

Edit `config/config.yaml`:
```yaml
camera_source:
  type: "rtsp"
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### RTSP Settings (config.yaml)

```yaml
rtsp:
  url: ""                     # Leave empty to load from credentials.yaml
  reconnect_attempts: 3       # Number of reconnection attempts
  reconnect_delay: 2          # Delay between reconnections (seconds)
  timeout: 10                 # Connection timeout (seconds)
  buffer_size: 1              # Frame buffer (1 = latest frame, reduces lag)
```

### Webcam Settings (config.yaml)

```yaml
webcam:
  index: 0                    # Camera device index
  width: 640                  # Frame width (0 for default)
  height: 480                 # Frame height (0 for default)
  fps: 30                     # Target FPS (0 for default)
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

**✅ Implemented:**
- Credentials stored in separate file (`credentials.yaml`)
- `.gitignore` excludes all credential files
- Example file provided for easy setup
- Credentials not shown in logs (only IP address)

**⚠️ Important:**
- **NEVER** commit `credentials.yaml` to git
- Keep credentials file secure
- Use strong passwords
- Change default camera passwords

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you can't connect:

1. **Verify camera is on:**
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.0.233
   ```

2. **Test with VLC:**
   - Open VLC → Media → Open Network Stream
   - Paste: `rtsp://jaijaish98-camera1:jaiSATHU@2407@192.168.0.233:554/stream1`
   - If it works in VLC, the URL is correct

3. **Check RTSP is enabled:**
   - Open Tapo app
   - Go to camera settings
   - Ensure RTSP is enabled

4. **Try lower quality stream:**
   ```yaml
   rtsp:
     url: "rtsp://jaijaish98-camera1:jaiSATHU@2407@192.168.0.233:554/stream2"
   ```

See [RTSP_CAMERA_SETUP.md](object_detection/RTSP_CAMERA_SETUP.md) for more troubleshooting.
