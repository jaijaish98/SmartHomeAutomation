# RTSP Camera Credentials
# 
# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. Copy this file to 'credentials.yaml' in the same directory
# 2. Fill in your actual RTSP URL with credentials
# 3. NEVER commit credentials.yaml to git (it's in .gitignore)
# 4. Keep this file secure and restrict access permissions
#
# Usage:
#   cp credentials.yaml.example credentials.yaml
#   # Edit credentials.yaml with your actual RTSP URL
#   # Set camera_source.type to "rtsp" in config.yaml

rtsp:
  # Full RTSP URL with credentials
  # Format: rtsp://username:password@ip_address:port/stream_path
