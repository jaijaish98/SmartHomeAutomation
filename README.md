# Smart Home Automation - Computer Vision

Professional YOLO-based object detection system for real-time detection of 80+ object types.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚡ One-Click Launch

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
cd object_detection
./run.sh
```

**macOS (Double-Click):**
Double-click `object_detection/START_OBJECT_DETECTION.command` in Finder

**Windows:**
```bash
cd object_detection
run.bat
```

**Cross-Platform:**
```bash
cd object_detection
python run.py
```

That's it! The launcher automatically:
- ✅ Installs dependencies
- ✅ Downloads YOLO model (~23 MB, first time only)
- ✅ Launches object detection

## 💡 Tips

1. **First time?** Just run `./run.sh` - everything is automatic
2. **macOS users:** Grant camera permissions (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera)
3. **Save detections:** Press 's' to save frames to `output/` folder
4. **Customize:** Edit `object_detection/config/config.yaml` for settings

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Camera Permission (macOS)
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera → Enable Terminal

### Python Not Found
Install from [python.org](https://python.org)

### Slow Performance
Already using fastest model (YOLOv4-tiny). Close other apps for better performance.
